-ROUTERS
-Regrouping api endpoints based on a domain (e.g users, products, etc)
-Created the utils folder where i saved some middlewares and other entities to make my code lighter
-Created an index file in the routes folder where we can connect all the inidividal entity routes before exporting it to the main index file
-Added CORS that helps me when i expose my api url to the outside world, without that step, my link won't be accessible.
